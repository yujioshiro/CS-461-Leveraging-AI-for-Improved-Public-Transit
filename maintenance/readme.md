# How to transfer the data

Make sure you have Python 3 installed and run `python3 mtnew.py` 

If you haven't changed anything, the file will load as mtdata.duckdb and my_table will be the table name. The file will be over 100MB, so it is hard to transfer and cannot be uploaded to github.

Note: If duckdb is not installed, you may have to run `pip3 install duckdb`
