This folder contains my (Jacob) progress for v0.7.

final_df.py is a script to merge all of our datasets into one DataFrame.

I have omitted the LTD data since I'm not sure if they want their data shared.

The script just needs to be ran and it will output the final DataFrame into the 'jacob/data/Final' folder

```
python final_df.py
```
