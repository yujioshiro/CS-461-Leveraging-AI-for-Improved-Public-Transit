This folder contains my beginnings of a PyTorch model to predict total ridership (total_board) of our processed data.

I have ommitted the actual dataset because I am unsure what they are okay with us sharing.
Since the script cannot be ran without the dataset, I have provided a screenshot of my results.

Results:
- The Model Architecture describes the model and it's layers
- RMSE indicates about a 4000 unit average error in ridership (not bad but not great)
- The R2 value (0.8898) indicates that this model is in a decent starting place but could ideally use some more refinement.
- The feature importance (provided in both an image, and in the terminal results) attempts to assign weights of importantance of each variable to total ridership.
