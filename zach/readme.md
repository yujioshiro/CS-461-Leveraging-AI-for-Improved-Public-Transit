# Zach's Data Analysis

The following code contains code for the data analysis of the Eugene weather data (zach.ipynb). It also contains files labeled "duckfile" which are methods I used to extract and aggregate LTD data, which can be leveraged for further data analysis. These DuckDB based files can be used for aggregating data for models as well.
